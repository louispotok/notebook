A basic daily notebook, inspired by [David MacIver's practice]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2020-06-15-first %}).

This notebook is hosted on Github Pages, and the code is available [here](https://github.com/louispotok/notebook). In particular, it is built with Jekyll, using the minima theme. The code to show revision history on each page is taken from [this post](https://ryanjduffy.github.io/blog/2016/01/08/including-git-history-in-a-jekyll-post.html) by Ryan Duffy.
