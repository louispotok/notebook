I spent January sitting in New York City waiting for the Indonesian border to reopen. Recoolit is funded above what I had planned for, the culmination of a lot of hard work and quite a bit of luck. But just as I began to prepare my departure the borders closed to keep out new strains of covid-19. Two weeks to start, and then extended for another two weeks, and then another. The current restrictions end February 8th but there's no way of knowing whether they'll be extended again.

This month I have felt like a bow being slowly drawn, tension rising and pressure building, feeling ready to be launched at Jakarta's refrigerant supply. But wait, am I the bow or the arrow? The arrow yearns for flight but feels no tension at all.

I'm doing what I can from here: building a network in Jakarta's startup scene and climate community and looking for my first hire. There are some promising early signals, but I just wish I was going faster, farther.

I've written before about the many places I've lived this year, the hospitality I've been given by friends, friends-of-friends, and even strangers.
