Just released a new [dataset](https://github.com/louispotok/green-cooling-data).

It infuriates me when organizations spend a ton of money to build a fancy website around some dataset and then don't make the data itself available. Luckily, that data is often available if you know a little bit about how the Web works, and how to use Developer Tools in your browser. It's hard to go around crusading for this but I think it's important, sort of a Robin Hood approach to open data.
