title: How close is too close?

We have a few cultural ideas that need to be reconciled:

1. It is hard to get a man to understand something when his paycheck depends on not understanding it.
1. Expertise requires deep engagement.
1. Value drift.


Let's say you're an outsider interested in understanding the debt collection industry, maybe because you want to find a [more ethical way](http://trueaccord.com/) to do it. How would you do that?

You could try and gather your own facts and make your own judgments. But you'll quickly find that most of the important information is not available to you. Most corners of the world face little pressure to make their work legible to curious outsiders, and in fact have a "dark forest" set of incentives where any public attention can only be harmful. Even if you are able to find the facts, you won't understand the system if you don't deeply understand the mental models used by insiders.

You could try to engage deeply with the insiders, and learn from them. But this has a few risks. First, they may not be forthcoming with you, again for Dark Forest reasons. Or if they are, it will be hard for you to engage with their ideas meaningfully. They've been learning from experience for decades, and you are receiving the conclusions without the raw facts. You may accept their insights uncritically, or struggle with them, but ultimately you'll have trouble knowing what to keep and what to throw out.

You could also try to gain the relevant experience yourself. This is where value drift comes into play. Several years of work will change you, you'll come out a different person. If you think debt collection is fundamentally a harmful institutions, how will you maintain that righteous clarity over multiple years of doing your job? Much more likely that you'll come to adopt the same rationalizations that you were fighting with to start.

People change over time, which is good. And your ethical judgment can change based on new information or new axioms. But you need to be careful that you don't lose your moral compass along the way.
