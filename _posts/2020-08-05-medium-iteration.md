A theory: if you take the same idea, and keep trying to present it in different media, you'll end up understanding it better.

For example, if you're trying to write something, first write it out in prose, then make a deck, then try to write it out in prose again.

This going back and forth should force you to keep focusing on the idea itself, rather than the medium constraints. 

Of course, respecting the medium is critical to the final product, but the more times you go back and forth, in theory, the more you'll whittle away the medium-dependent aspects and get to the core of the idea.
