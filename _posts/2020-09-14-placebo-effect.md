The placebo effect feels fundamentally important. We discovered that, in addition to the mechanistic response that medicine has, there is a kind of response based purely on belief and expectation. As best I can tell, we don't understand how it works, or under what conditions. But we control for it when testing drugs.

Doesn't this seem fundamental to understanding the human body and illness?

I would like to read an up-to-date, appropriately skeptical review of the current state of knowledge on the placebo effect.

There is some indication (see [SSC](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/31/powerless-placebos/)) that what we used to think of as the placebo effect is really just regression to the mean. See also a [related discussion on LessWrong]( https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tjTuzmCYxfsgkKdQx/fallacies-of-reification-the-placebo-effect) where the author points out that there is a whole package of relevant "control response", of which the "placebo effect" (belief is curative) is only a small part.
