The Library of Alexandria is burning. Our collective knowledge, understanding and wisdom are collected all in one place, and we have neglected their safety. Thick black smoke fills the sky. Our greatest scholars and philosophers lie dead in the street. The manuscripts are irreplaceable, the cost to human flourishing immense. We enter a thousand-year period of darkness.

Actually, what happened is that Scott Alexander took down his blog.

<details>
  <summary>Click here if you're unfamiliar with Slate Star Codex and/or the recent controversy.</summary>

Scott is the pseudonymous[^terminology] writer of the blog Slate Star Codex. It's hard to overstate how important this blog is to its readers. It's a common watering hole at the intersection of a number of communities, widely respected for its intelligence, thoughtfulness, and overall humane approach to complex and sensitive topics. It's also quite funny.

[^terminology]: My understanding of the different between anonymity and pseudonymity is that they can, but don't have to, coexist. Mark Twain is a non-anonymous pseudonym. An unsigned letter to your local newspaper is anonymous but not pseudonymous. Satoshi is an anonymous pseudonym. This is not static in time: Publius was an anonymous pseudonym, and is now only a pseudonym. I don't care very much about the distinction and so I'll be a bit sloppy in the rest of the essay.

SSC dates back to 2013, though Scott has been actively writing on the internet (as `yvain` among other names) since 2005: platforms I know of include Lesswrong, tumblr, and livejournal.

For a few days, rumors have been circulating that the New York Times is writing a piece on SSC and its community. A reporter from the Times has been reaching out to folks who comment on the blog or engage in the related conversations on Twitter.

Many in the community have seen this as a bad thing: dangerous for themselves personally, and dangerous for the continued health and vitality of the community. The main response I've seen is for people to"lock" their Twitter accounts, meaning that only their followers can see their posts, and all new followers need to be approved.

Today, Scott confirmed the rumors of an NYT piece being written, and deleted his blog. In its place is a single post explaining the situation, which I'll summarize here:
1. A reporter at the NYT is writing a piece about SSC, this "probably would have been a very nice article."
1. The reporter intended to publish Scott's real name.
1. There are two reasons Scott has chosen to be pseudonymous:
	1. Scott is a practicing psychiatrist, and having his blog associated with his real name could harm his ability to care for his patients.
	1. Minimizing personal risk to him and his housemates: he has received death threats, and at least one member of the community has been SWATted.
1. Scott shared those worries with the reporter, who told him that it is NYT policy to use real names.
1. Scott deleted his blog to discourage the Times from publishing the story. Now if they do publish, the story will have to include a discussion of this episode.

I have seen widespread condemnation of the Times, from among others:
* Alex Tabbarok
* Matt Yglesias
* Adam Gurri

There are a few questions to break down here:
1. How can we understand anonymity?
1. How does the internet change things?
1. What do we mean by journalism?
1. What are the responsibilities of the news industry, and the NYT specifically?


## About Anonymity

Why do people write anonymously?

### Harm Prevention
Anonymity can prevent harm to the writer and their loved ones. Writing under your own name can be dangerous if your writing angers people with power over you. In history class, we learn about danger from repressive states: we picture brave dissidents publishing bold manifestos, revolutionaries evading the secret police. The threat landscape in 2020 in the US is different. A few new sources of danger:
1. Individuals harming you directly through stalking, harassment, or violence.
1. Using state power to harm you through eg SWATting.
1. Leveraging public outrage campaigns against you. The most likely direct effect is professional damage -- getting fired and making it difficult to get a new job. But by calling negative attention to you this also increases the risk of (1) and (2).

Privacy is not absolute, there is no single barrier between private and not-private. Knowing a person's legal name does not by itself allow you to visit harm upon them. But it makes it much easier to look up their address, find their employer, etc. The precautions that an individual takes are about balancing the tradeoff between privacy and ease.

### Setting the tone
It is impossible, I think, to read a written work and not want to know something about the author. It is difficult to evaluate arguments based only on content, we constantly seek social signals to ease the process. If the writer is high status we become more generous readers, are less likely to disagree. We want to know the author's biases, just as we force academics to disclose conflicts of interest. We have a sense, I think, that people will write "better" in some way if their reputation is on the line.

Anonymity short-circuits this. It is a rhetorical move that says: "the content is all that matter. Evaluate the ideas, not the writer." It relies on an extreme version of the marketplace of ideas, where no argument from authority is possible. It signals a willingness to let your ideas stand or fall on their own merits.

This points to a difference between philosophy and journalism. The point of journalism is not really to interrogate ideas, right? A philosopher can evaluate an idea on its own terms and should not need to know the author's identity. Journalism is different, it is about tracing connections in the physical or human worlds.

## How does the internet change things?

### The eye

We live in a world dominated by attention. The existence of massive internet platforms allows enormous amounts of attention to swing quickly onto any target, no matter its size. The dynamics by which certain targets are chosen, by whom, and what causes certain attempts to succeed or fail, are complex. Of course sometimes the attention is desired, but often not. There's a version of this that I imagine as the Eye of Sauron and call "the global eye of capital": think of Airbnb suddenly promoting a trendy neighborhood in Barcelona. Demand causes prices to rise causes more sellers to enter the market: a well-known and well-understood phenomena except that it happens so massively and quickly. Six months later the neighborhood is all tourists. 

No city or individual, and few companies or institutions can handle this amount of attention. Your input channels get flooded. A few malicious and skilled agents look for weaknesses and seek to do real harm.

This is not a new phenomenon, but its modern form does not become apparent until the Gamergate controversy in 2013-14. There was a flood of good writing about this at the time and over the several years following. One of the best writers on the topic was Sarah Jeong, who even wrote a [book](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17777330/internet-of-garbage-book-sarah-jeong-online-harassment) about it. In 2018, on the strength of this and other work, Jeong was appointed to the editorial board of ... The New York Times.[^more-jeong]

[^more-jeong]: She has since left the editorial board, though she is still an op-ed writer for the paper. Some more links for the curious include a [recent piece](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/15/opinion/gamergate-zoe-quinn.html) of hers on online harassment, and a [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/business/media/sarah-jeong-new-york-times.html) about the harassment she endured when appointed to the board.

### The cascade

I think about [this tweet](https://twitter.com/maplecocaine/status/1080665226410889217) very often: 
> Each day on twitter there is one main character. The goal is to never be it. 

When you post on social media you have to think: what would happen if this got 10k retweets? Would it lead people to hate me? Could it be taken out of context and used to paint me, or some group that I'm adjacent to, as evil?

Every action must be scrutinized in this context. Should you post a photo from the park, such that someone could come find you? Should you tell your followers you're going on vacation? If you have a large account, should you retweet when someone else posts like that?

Absent a coherent theory of the dynamics of the eye, we must proceed with caution at all stages.


### The memory

Finally, any information, once published, is forever at anyone's fingertips. There is no forgetting -- no action can be undone.


### The adaptation

Individuals, for the most part, understand these dynamics and have modified their behavior to live within our new world. And of course some are fighting these structures, these new incentives. 

Institutions seem to be slower to adapt, like great ships turning when the wind changes. They have standards bodies. The reasoning must be legible. They have decades of precedent. It is relatively easy to hire a social media team to post memes on Twitter; harder for the NYT to understand that its core model may need to change.

## What's a journalist?

A journalist, I would think 


* Legal liability for acts of harm resulting from doxxing
doxxing should expose you to legal liability in the event of resulting harms, with damages proportional to
1. how much you amplified attention on the subject 
2. how much you made it easier to find the identifying information
* we live in a world dominated by attention flows, and the brokers of this should be aware of the power they wield. I think journalists fundamentally see themselves as not-powerful.
