Will the future continue to be like the past? Well, it depends on what we think the past was like.

What characterizes the past, in terms of economic productivity? [^flourishing]. Not a single level, surely: we are richer than our great-grandparents, and so on back down the line. We can say ([with Butler](https://louispotok.com/book-review-earthseed-series-octavia-butler/)) that "the only constant is change", but we are rigorous mathematical people and we strive to do better. 
[^flourishing]"Human flourishing" being at this time too tricky to measure.

In a new [blog post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory#) for Open Philanthropy, David Roodman analyzes the past to try and understand the "human trajectory" [^roodman-bio]. He takes a time series of Gross World Product (GWP) since 10,000 BCE and finds that exponential growth, which is our casual term for "really fast", is actually too slow. Mathematically, exponential growth means "growth rate is constant". If GWP was under exponential growth, we'd see an increase of (say) 3% yearly, which means it would double at a fixed period (23 years, the rule of thumb is 70 / the growth rate). However what Roodman finds, in line with previous research, is that we have grown faster than this: the doubling time keeps speeding up.

[^roodman-bio]Roodman is a consumate scholar: humane, brilliant, deeply curious, and an excellent writer. I always assumed he had gone through the traditional academic path but he seems to be self-taught since undergrad.

This seems good! This is the ultimate "hockey stick" graph

A few directions to go:
* Economic growth
* different regimes of growth
* similar: singularities as pointing to breakdowns in models (a la relativity)
