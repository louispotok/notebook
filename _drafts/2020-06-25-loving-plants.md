Indoor plants are having a moment. Why?

One hypothesis is that plants look nice, or that having a plant delivers some other benefit like cleaner air, or more oxygen. We can break this apart

* plants look nice : it's about the outcome
* the process of taking care of a plant : it's about the process
* if you own a house you have a lawn. people are obssessed with lawns too.
