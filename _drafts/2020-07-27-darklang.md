I've been participating in the beta release of Dark, an interesting new developer tools product. Dark is an integrated development environment to build backend systems, which consists of:
* a programming language
* an editor for that language
* a GUI interface to your infrastructure

You have a canvas with different elements, which can be:
* HTTP endpoints
* Datastores
* Cron jobs
*
