What is needed here? more concrete examples?

---

I see many well-intentioned people pick up noble causes and then completely fail to make the smallest impact. Usually, they say something like "we're trying to raise awareness of this important cause".

To me this is usually indicates that they have a pseudo-mystical belief system, or have failed to think through the problem in any depth.

Let's walk through an example to be a bit more concrete. Factory farmed meat is immensely cruel and incredibly destructive for the environment. Many organizations try to "raise awareness" of these facts. There's an implicit theory of change here:

1. Increased public awareness
1. ?? Unspecified intermediate steps
1. ?? Unspecified "better" outcomes

To be fair, many of these organizations have actually specified the intermediate steps: ballot propositions, people becoming vegetarian or choosing to eat only ethically-raised meat. And there is often a call to action.

You can interpret the causal model behind these awareness campaigns in, I think, two ways:
1. Information provision: People do not have enough information about the costs and benefits surrounding the issue. Once you provide costs and benefits, they'll do the right thing: the thing that this organization wants them to do.
1. Salience: people already know, intellectually, about the things you're telling them. But they have limited time and attention, and this aspect is not highly salient to their choice. If you make this issue top of mind, make it emotional, then they will change their behavior.



I am struggling to capture in words the depth of my dislike for awareness campaigns.



I am beset on all sides by "awareness campaigns". I live in a state of heightened awareness to all the world's problems. Once I become aware of an issue.

When you think about complex social problems, "awareness campaigns" are very rarely the solution.

First of all, per [Rittel and Webber]({{site.baseurl}}{% link assets/pdf/rittel1973.pdf %}), most interesting problems do not have "a solution":
> policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optimal solutions" to social problems unless severe qualifications are imposed first. Even worse, there are no "solutions" in the sense of definitive and objective answers.

But awareness campaigns are particularly bad.

"Raising awareness" is usually a bad goal. Or it's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Generally what 


"raising awareness" is not a good goal
usually more about persuasion - people are aware of your shitty cause they just don't care
they rarely actually work.
limited attention
public good
limited capacity
hard to scale
culturally out of touch
consumer choice as the key lever
you're actually trying to change culture, often.
