Indonesia, Etc: Exploring the Improbable Nation by Elizabeth Pisani ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3tLyidk))

Indonesia is an enormous, complicated country. 

It is also at a crossroads.

Pisani is a journalist-turned-epidemiologist, fluent in Indonesian, who has spent many years there. 

How can you write a book about a nation of 250 million people, 13 thousand islands, and 700 languages? 

This is a travelogue - she goes all over the country, from the tiny islands at one side to the populous island of Java. But there's one major absence in the book: she doesn't write about Jakarta. A city of 10 million, with a metro area of 35 million. Indonesia's cultural, political, economic heart. Why does she do this? It's not the "real" indonesia? It's too well-covered? She doesn't find it interesting, or novel?

The same for Bali, though I understand that absence better: that really is the one place Westerners are likely to have been.


The title:
> When the country’s founding fathers declared independence from Dutch colonists in 1945, the declaration read, in its entirety: ‘We, the people of Indonesia, hereby declare the independence of Indonesia. Matters relating to the transfer of power etc. will be executed carefully and as soon as possible.’ Indonesia has been working on that ‘etc.’ ever since.

On Indonesia's size and diversity:
> Modern Indonesia runs around the girdle of the Earth, covering the distance from London to Tehran, or from Anchorage in Alaska to Washington DC. At the north-western extreme on the tip of Sumatra is Aceh, peopled by Muslim Malays with a dash of Arab etched into their features who are proud to call their land ‘the Veranda of Mecca’. Some 5,200 kilometres to the south-east is the province of Papua, which makes up much of the western half of the giant island of New Guinea, home to black-skinned people many of whom, when I first visited, went naked but for penis-gourds, and who had developed some of the most sophisticated farming techniques in the archipelago.

In a previous review I wrote about the Indonesian nationalist movement and the Japanese inspiration. This story has a second part:
> Japan had invaded the Netherlands East Indies in 1942, kicking the Dutch colonists out of the islands. This was a cause for celebration among Indonesian nationalists; 350 years of Dutch kleptocracy left them deeply distrustful of white rulers. But the Japanese turned out to be just as bad, though in different ways.


This is handy! 
> Around the equator, the winds change direction mid-year. That provided a convenient conveyor belt between China and India, the two powerhouses of production and consumption at the time. They blew south from China between December and March, and provided a fast passage up to India from June to September.

I always thought of the doldrums as a region, not a time. Imagine the routine of the year, several months of sitting with the other traders in Jakarta waiting for the wind to turn.
> In the interim months, the islands sat in the fickle-winded Doldrums. During these months, traders stayed in the bustling ports that grew up to meet their needs. They unloaded and reloaded, they refitted and provisioned ships, they married local girls in each port and left them to source cargo for their next visit. From the eastern islands of Maluku came nutmeg and cloves. From the other end of the island chain, the Sultanates of Aceh and Sumatra, came pepper.


Language, and hatred of Malay
> Born again as ‘Indonesian’ for political reasons in 1928, the lingua franca of these islands is actually a form of Malay which has been used by traders for millennia. Foreign merchants moved through the polyglot communities of the straits in waves; the Persians dominated in the seventh century, but were later eclipsed by the Arabs. They in turn were challenged by Indians from Gujarat on the west coast and Coromandel on the east, while the Chinese began a strong showing from the 1100s.
                
A brief history lesson:
> From the seventh century, scholars travelling with Indian merchants began to spread the Hindu and Buddhist religions to the southern Sumatran kingdom of Sriwijaya, which went on to become the region’s first indigenous empire. The rulers of Sriwijaya grew rich enough on trade to build up armies and conquer neighbouring islands, spreading their religions across the water to Java
> The next wave of traders were Muslims from South Asia, southern China and the Middle East. Because a shared religion greased the wheels of commerce – men could eat and pray together – the traders of the islands were among the first to adopt Islam. Over time, Javanese princes abandoned their Sanskrit names and began to take the title of Sultan. By the start of the sixteenth century, virtually all of Java’s rulers had converted; only Bali, directly to the east of Java, kept its Hindu courts and its caste system.
> When Constantinople fell to the Turks in the mid-fifteenth century, Christian businessmen could no longer easily buy from Muslim traders. By that time, spices were an essential ingredient in the larders of rich Europeans – spices preserved meat in an age before refrigeration, and they masked the taste when the flesh rotted. If Europeans wanted to maintain the supply of pepper, cloves and nutmeg, they would have to go directly to the islands where the spices were grown. That became possible in 1497, when the Portuguese adventurer Vasco da Gama sailed around the bottom of Africa and ‘discovered’ the sea route to the East. The Portuguese quickly found their way to Maluku, home to the most precious spices. They made first for Ternate, a volcano island cloaked in cloves. On its frilled skirt, a buzzing town now boasts relics of that time: two Portuguese forts and the Sultan’s palace.
                
> VOC wanted to buy up every single clove, but they couldn’t – almost every family in the northern Maluku islands owned trees, and they would rather sell them to Muslim traders than to these hairy white infidels. Then the Gentlemen 17 hit upon the idea of destroying the clove trees in all but one island, Ambon. They paid the local sultans handsomely to achieve this, beginning a tradition of bribing and co-opting local leaders that was to last for over three centuries. The market for nutmeg should have been easier to corner, because at the time, it only grew in one place on earth: the tiny, isolated Banda islands
                

> The monopolies on cloves and nutmeg contributed disproportionately to the income of the VOC for many decades, but the cost of enforcing the monopolies was also high. The company got sucked into a series of expensive wars between squabbling Javanese princes, and was distracted, too, from its profitable trade with China. The VOC began to lose money; in 1798 it toppled into bankruptcy. By then, just four years short of its 200th anniversary, it employed 50,000 people and had a fleet of close to 150 trading ships and dozens of warships. The VOC was deemed Too Big To Fail; the Dutch crown took over the company’s ‘possessions’ and its debts. It was to rule the colony of the Netherlands East Indies until the Japanese invaded 150 years later. It was unclear, though, what exactly constituted the Netherlands East Indies.
                

The Dutch interest was purely commercial:
> If an island or a region could produce nothing of interest to Dutch businessmen, the colonizers allowed local princelings to carry on setting the rules until well into the 1880s.
                

Dutch liberals begin to care (as seen in This Earth of Mankind):
> At one stage, half of the Netherlands’ national income was being siphoned in from Indonesia. At the beginning of the twentieth century, left-leaning politicians in the Netherlands forced through the ‘Ethical Policy’. This recognized that the government of the Netherlands East Indies bore some responsibility for the welfare of the 34 million people who then lived nominally under Dutch rule. The colonists were obliged to start setting up schools for the children of the more privileged ‘natives’. The new ethics did not, however, stop the government in the colony’s capital Batavia (now Jakarta) from waging war on other natives.
> Ironically, it was the well-meaning ethical policy that sowed the seeds of a true anti-colonial movement. For the first time, young ‘natives’ were allowed an education, and in a European language that gave them access to books and newspapers full of new ideas about sovereignty and social justice. For the first time, young men from across the archipelago came together in the major cities of Java, finding common cause against a common enemy. It was in the minds of these young men that the notion of Indonesia was conceived. It was made flesh in 1928, when a congress of youth groups from around the archipelago pledged, in the name of the ‘sons and daughters of Indonesia’, that they would fight for ‘One Homeland: Indonesia. One Nation: Indonesia. One Language: Indonesian.’
> It was the Japanese occupation that really catalysed Indonesian independence. By dispatching the Dutch so swiftly, the Japanese shattered the myth of European superiority. Espousing ‘Asia for the Asians’, they encouraged Sukarno and other nationalists to prepare for self-rule within an Asian commonwealth. And because they anticipated an Allied invasion, they set about militarizing the Indonesians, training many young men in the use of arms and guerrilla warfare.
                
                

                
The post-independence period:
> Sukarno did not immediately get his way; he was denied a place at the table at which the formal transfer of sovereignty from the Netherlands was negotiated because he was considered to have collaborated with the Japanese. When the Dutch offered self-rule for seven individual federated states within the United Republic of Indonesia, a commonwealth headed by the Dutch crown, Hatta and Sjahrir signed up. Within a year, however, support for a federation had imploded and Sukarno was firmly back on track towards a unitary state ruled from Jakarta.

## Doesn't have clear boundaries, different parts are always up for fighting:
> The Netherlands had retrospectively excluded mineral-rich West Papua from the territory it handed over to the nationalists. It’s ours, said Sukarno, and went to the United Nations – a bold move for a newborn nation. Most countries at the UN sided with the flamboyant polyglot, though not enough to force UN action. That allowed Sukarno to keep up his nationalist belligerence. In 1961 he sent the paratroopers into Papua to begin the process of grabbing back what belonged, in the eyes of most Indonesians but few Papuans, to the republic.

Hm, the history of Timor. I remember in high school, I had a summer job updating some software encyclopedia/history curriculum. We had to update all these profiles for each country and, surprise, we ended up having to add East Timor as a separate country
> the eastern half of the island of Timor, the Dutch never set foot at all. The Portuguese had settled in East Timor after being ousted by the people of Ternate in the sixteenth century. It remained a Portuguese enclave until 1975, when Lisbon abandoned it following a socialist revolution at home. Indonesia quickly sent in troops and ‘integrated’ East Timor as the nation’s twenty-seventh province.
                
> After that, Sukarno started thumping his chest in the direction of former British colonies to the north which were trying to band together into a new country, Malaysia. He used the UN again, this time withdrawing Indonesia from the world body in protest at Malaysia’s seat on the Security Council.
                

Sukarno -> Suharto and the genocide:
> On the night of 30 September 1965 the situation came to a head. The official version of events, publicly accepted for years, defies logic on virtually every level. It holds that a group of officers from the army worked in cahoots with the PKI to plan a coup against Sukarno. This seems unlikely; the army broadly loathed the PKI, while Sukarno was in fact a great supporter of the communists. The ‘rebel’ officers killed six generals and seized the national radio station. Suharto, then the commander of the Strategic Reserve, stepped in to save the day, ousting the traitors, restoring calm, and securing the safety of President Sukarno – so school children are taught. What they are not told is that Suharto later placed his predecessor under house arrest.
> Whatever the truth, the events of that night certainly unleashed a tsunami of anti-PKI propaganda, followed by revenge killings, begun by the army itself. Many ordinary Indonesians joined in with gusto. Different groups used the great orgy of violence to settle different scores. In East Java, Muslims got back at their long-time communist rivals. In Bali, as many as one person in twenty was killed – the highest rate in Indonesia.
                

Pisani's history and the two types of dictators:
> I had arrived in Jakarta to work for Reuters in 1988, when Suharto was in his twenty-first year in power, yet when I walked into the newsroom – a dreary, grey place inhabited by clunky screens winking green text against a black page – I had barely heard of the man. Suharto was remarkable among dictators precisely for being so outwardly unremarkable: a quiet, methodical person who lived modestly and put stability before all else. Where Sukarno had appeared at massive rallies in the guise of a visionary saviour of the people, Suharto appeared at family planning clinics in the guise of a concerned uncle. Where Sukarno had called together the leaders of the post-colonial world and kick-started the non-aligned movement, Suharto called together farmers and kick-started campaigns to keep rats out of rice fields.
                
How do you turn a scattered set of islands into a nation? Policy + media.
> Suharto undermined the very foundation of many of the nation’s cultures. He hoped they would be rebuilt with a set of building blocks that were identical nationwide. There were five principal levels of government: nation, province, district, sub-district, and village. They followed a fairly strict chain of command. Suharto stripped the provinces of any vestige of decision-making, appointing governors – many of them military men, several of them Javanese, all of them fiercely loyal – to do Jakarta’s bidding. He backed them up with two uniformed armies, both also largely Javanese. The first was of soldiers, who were given licence under a doctrine known as ‘dual function’ to meddle in civilian life down to the village level. The second was of civil servants. The distinction between the two was not always clear.
>  he needed a platform to tell Indonesians, all Indonesians, about their part in building this glorious nation. Telly was going to be that platform, he decided. In the mid-1970s Indonesia launched a satellite with a footprint that covered the whole country (and dusted most of South East Asia as well). It was a bold move – the US and Canada were the only countries in the world with domestic satellites at that stage – and it was a move Indonesia could ill afford.
                
> Once the satellite was launched, the government began handing out ‘public’ TV sets, 50,000 of them a year. They usually sat in the home of the headman; the whole village crammed in of an evening to watch together. There was only one channel on offer, TVRI. The airwaves over the outer islands were suddenly crammed with images of national development. And with ads. Many in Jakarta worried about that. It was one thing to advertise consumer goods to the privileged few who could afford televisions in the largely urban areas covered by the terrestrial stations. But it was potentially dangerous to show the Have-Nots in the villages and on distant islands the cornucopia of consumer goods that was on offer to the Haves in Java. Satellite TV was supposed to turn the tribes of the land into Indonesians, not to turn them into an army of disgruntled Want-But-Never-Could-Haves. In 1981 Suharto banned advertising on telly ‘to avoid detrimental effects which do not promote the spirit of development’. That freed up more programming time for his own messages.
                
> Then, in 1989, TVRI’s monopoly was broken. Suharto handed out licences for private stations first to his son Bambang, then, in quick succession, to his cousin Sudwikatmono and his daughter Tutut. Suharto allowed his family to import soap operas from Latin America, to sprinkle them liberally with advertisements, to drop any pretence that TV might have a social purpose.
                


Indonesia has its own "chicago boys",but from Berkeley.
> Though he put generals in charge of most aspects of Indonesian life, Suharto had the good sense to put the economy into the hands of a small clique of competent and cautious economists collectively known as the ‘Berkeley mafia’ because many of them had studied in California with sponsorship from the Ford Foundation. They first pushed through policies that got agriculture back on its feet. The country went from being the world’s biggest importer of rice to being a net exporter.
                

Minor, but this is a contradiction. If "life was getting better", then "all the growth" is not going into a handful of pockets.
> They went wrong in part because life was getting so much better. With their basic needs met and a better education, people began to want more. They could see the economy booming, then saw all the growth go into a handful of pockets.
                

This is an amazing story.
> When I arrived in late 1988, there were only twenty-four shares listed on the Jakarta exchange, and foreigners were only allowed to buy eight of them. I bought a handful of shares in three listed companies on one day, just for the fun of it, and I accounted for nearly a quarter of the day’s stock-market turnover.
                

The Chinese are basically Jews
> The ethnic Chinese walk a knife-edge in modern Indonesia. They are assumed to be universally wealthy and are seen by many as leeches, but they provide the capital and business skills that keep the economy growing. Their wealth is tolerated as long as they stay out of politics, and they usually try to avoid controversy.
                

Damn, national pride doing the right thing.
> In 1986, Indonesia lost its hard-won self-sufficiency in rice. That mattered more to Suharto than his family’s income; he immediately wiped out subsidies, banned broad-spectrum pesticides, and set up thousands of field schools like the one I went to, to teach farmers to tell good bugs from bad bugs and so cut pesticide use.
                
Suharto era ends.
> In May 1998, after thirty-two years in power, Suharto resigned. A new Indonesia was born, but no one had the slightest idea who should raise it.
                
trans culture
> The transgenders, or waria, on the other hand, had been feature of Jakarta life for as long as I could remember. Though the word is a mash-up of wanita – woman – and pria – man, waria live entirely as women, sometimes with a husband. Most still have all their male anatomy intact, though many take female hormones, and breast implants are increasingly common. Culturally, they play a very singular role. They are accepted in part because of a long heritage that stems from the Bissu priests who often sailed in the magnificent trading schooners built by the Bugis people of South Sulawesi. The Bissu are often described as ‘intersex’; they are said still now to be able to channel the gods when in a trance.
                

> In 2004 Indonesia held its first direct presidential election; until then, presidents had been chosen by the legislature.
                

No idea there was horse country:
> For a couple of hundred years, Sumba interested the outside world because it was covered in sandalwood. Once that had been clear-felled and sold, it turned into a landscape of rolling grassland, toasted brown for much of the year by the pitiless southern sun. In the dry season it’s vaguely reminiscent of the Meseta Central in Spain, not least because it is good horse country and jousting is a favourite sport. It’s not uncommon to see, silhouetted against the evening sky, a man on a stocky pony holding a lance, for all the world like Don Quixote.
                

this is just baller
> The one lonely administrator sent to establish a Dutch foothold on Sumba in the 1870s reported back to his bosses in the colonial capital of Batavia that ‘there is no other rule than that of the strongest’. Headhunting and slave raids, he said, had ‘reduced the value of a human life to a very low level, often well below that of a horse’. The Dutch didn’t consolidate their hold on Sumba until 1913, after a bloody two-year fight against the famous headhunter Wono Kaka. He had provoked the Dutch by decapitating soldiers and hanging their scalps with those of his other enemies on his clan’s skull tree.
                

Useful: 
> Adat is one of those Indonesian words that defies translation; quite specific, but somehow hard to grasp, like a cloud. Crudely, adat is a cultural tradition, but in the days before Suharto and his wife tried to pare it down and scrub it up to display in the pavilions of Mini Indonesia, it was much, much more than that. Adat is rarely spoken of in big cities like Jakarta. But in many islands, the engines of communal life – birth and death, marriage and divorce, inheritance, conservation, education – are fuelled by the body of lore and transmitted wisdom that is adat.
                

People understand the point of these government programs:
> I remarked that the government’s family planning programme didn’t seem to have made much headway in these parts. ‘Thank goodness,’ he said. ‘If you only have a few children, you’re going to want to educate them. Then all of this – ’ he waved his hand to indicate the witches-hat houses, the carved gravestones, the bloodstains that remain from the ceremonial slaughter the night before, the elder whittling at the drum – ‘all this will be lost.’
                

Heh, cute story:
In even the smallest town in Indonesia, the post office, dressed in orange livery, is a little island of efficiency. Its staff are well trained, friendly and almost embarrassingly helpful. They will keep the office open as you dash to the market to buy a rice-sack to wrap your parcel in, then help you sew the parcel up with thread that they dig out of their own handbags. They’ll telephone to let you know that this week’s boat has been cancelled so your parcel won’t leave for another ten days. ‘When Indonesian institutions have to line up at the gates of heaven, the post office will be let in first,’ one old postmaster told me, and I agreed.

It was payment day for the families with poverty cards. The key to Indonesia’s nascent social security system, these cards provide access to subsidized rice, free medical care and cash payments.

But the aspirations of young people in a modern economy have been clashing with the demands of family and traditions in other parts of the country for nearly a century. Indeed the first modern Indonesian novel, Marah Rusli’s Sitti Nurbaya, deals with exactly this tension. It was published in 1922.

In Sumba’s sticky culture, there are two quite separate types of capital. Financial capital – money, cement, shops – can be turned into buffalo, tombstones and other forms of cultural capital. But it’s a one-way street. Cultural capital is the property of the whole clan, living and dead. You contribute to it, and it assures your place in the world. You can’t sell it off to pay for one child’s education, a new generator for your workshop or an Indomaret franchise. When I implied that Pak Petrus could turn a buffalo into six months of travel, I might as well have suggested privatizing air and selling it to buy a gold-plated toilet.

‘All right clever clogs, what island comes next to Kisar?’ We agreed to have a geography competition when I was next in Sumba, and that evening I walked around Waikabubak looking for a map to give them so that they could study. I could buy maps of the district of West Sumba, and even of NTT, the province in which Sumba sits. But in all of Waikabubak there was not a map of the nation to be had. I asked the stony-faced Chinese traders in the general stores, expecting hands to be inserted into the dusty mountains of goods and a map to emerge, but no. Nothing in the bookshop, or in the town’s many stationery stores. In Sumba, the nation didn’t exist.

I hadn’t guessed that the river might be hot because there was no sign of its having been turned into an obyek wisata, a ‘tourism object’. Though it sounds odd in English, ‘tourism objects’ lie at the core of Indonesian officialdom’s concept of the travel industry. Spectacularly beautiful waterfalls are turned into obyek wisata with the construction of cement tables and stools fashioned to look like cut pine trees. Pristine beaches are walled off behind pink concrete, broken only by a welcoming archway that proclaims ‘Welcome to Sunset Beach Tourism Object’! Hot springs get funnelled into slimy tiled baths hidden in rickety wooden sheds. Pathways through spectacular gorges are lined with vendors and littered with discarded drink cartons.

Remarkably few Indonesians have chosen to settle in other countries. They do travel as contract labourers: in 2012, four million Indonesians trekked overseas to clean other people’s loos, weed their plantations and build their hotels, mostly in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. But almost all of these people are on ‘package deal’ schemes; they are sent out in batches by government-approved agents and will be brought home when their contracts are up. This is not the sort of migration of which a diaspora is made, and it is a diaspora that spreads a country’s influence overseas.

Every region has its own cuisine, but in the small towns in poor islands in which I spent the first months of my travels, the local fare was frustratingly difficult to sample. Only when I was invited into people’s homes did I get to try papaya leaves with marsh weeds or sweetcorn and pumpkin mash. On the streets and in hole-in-the-wall restaurants, food is provided by a handful of itinerant tribes who have cooked their way across the nation. Most famously, the Minangkabau of West Sumatra who gave us nasi Padang, the cuisine named after their provincial capital.

The es kelapa boys are among the best-travelled Indonesians I know. They drift from island to island, from small town to small town. ‘It never ceases to amaze me,’ said one young Sasak man. ‘There are coconuts all around, but the locals never think to sell them. Then one of us comes along, and we do a good business for two or three months. Finally, three or four locals decide that they can do it too, and then the market is saturated and we move on somewhere else.’ Doesn’t

It’s hard work, standing out here in the sun ten hours a day. The locals are too lazy to keep it going for long.

Then there’s no es kelapa until another Sasak moves in.’

Like many languages that evolved principally to ease negotiation in polyglot marketplaces, trading Malay/Indonesian is grammatically very simple. Instead of fussing with plurals, Indonesian just doubles up the noun. Anak: child; anak anak (often written anak2): children. There are no tenses; Indonesians just stick time words into the sentence to indicate past, present or future. ‘I pay you yesterday,’ or ‘I pay you tomorrow.’ It’s also a very vague language, besok – ‘tomorrow’ – can mean the day after today, but it can also mean some unspecified time in the not-too-distant future.

Though plants seemed to spring out of the ground with no husbanding at all, many Indonesians, especially in the eastern islands, seem to feel that green vegetables are not real food. The result is that fertile Indonesia has astoundingly high levels of malnutrition. According to the Ministry of Health, more than a quarter of children under five in Indonesia are anaemic and 11.5 million Indonesian kids of that age – well over a third of the total nationwide – are significantly shorter than they should be for their age.

Ironically, the trek to drudgery in Malaysia has probably done more to foster pan-Indonesian nationalism than almost anything in the post-Suharto era. The entrenched antagonism between giant Indonesia and its smallish northern neighbour is in part a hangover from President Sukarno’s anti-Malaysia grandstanding of the early 1960s. And in part it’s good, old-fashioned envy.

The chains of command so carefully wrought by Suharto – chains that passed the will of the capital’s bureaucrats down to the villages and sucked resources and information back to the centre – have, during The Reformation, been shattered. And the shattering is deliberate. It was largely the idea of President Habibie, who stepped into Suharto’s shoes when the Old Man threw in the towel in 1998. Decentralization was a reaction to Indonesia’s loss of East Timor. Blindsided by Jakarta’s crushing defeat, Habibie was forced to wonder what implications East Timor’s referendum on independence might have for the rest of the country. Lots of other regions felt they had been slighted by the Suharto oligarchy.

In fact Indonesians even use the word ‘blossoming’, pemekaran, to describe the administrative shattering of the nation. Since Suharto resigned, the country has added another ten provinces; by the time I finished my wanderings in Indonesia in late 2012, the number of districts had increased by 70 per cent, blossoming to 509.

In Kisar, where we stopped for a whole day, a fellow passenger, Harry, offered to show me the sights. On his motorbike, we buzzed down to the end of the island and looked across at East Timor, now a nation in its own right. We slowed down as instructed in front of the military barracks. (‘Nothing but trouble, those boys,’ said Harry, contradicting what I had heard from the retired soldier.) We stopped to look at the airstrip. And we went to visit Pak Hermanus, an ancient, hook-nosed gentleman who speaks only Oirata, a minority language even on the island of Kisar, and is said to belong to one of the Lost Tribes of Israel. A busybody Christian from Jakarta had whisked Hermanus off to the Holy Land the year before in the hope of hastening the Second Coming of Christ.

During the reading of the administrative notices, the church warden announced that there was a new sasi, a taboo, on collecting sea slugs, while the sasi on Pak Okto’s mango tree was lifted. Sasi (or pomali further south in NTT) works as a traditional form of resource management. Most often, the taboo is declared by village elders to prevent overfishing in the breeding season or to husband communal resources.

I have come to make a distinction between patronage and corruption. Indonesians make the distinction all the time in their lives and their voting patterns, though not, interestingly, in their language. Indonesians love to talk about corruption, which they usually abbreviate to KKN, for Korupsi, Kolusi, Nepotism.

The difficulty was with his parents, who were adamant that he should get a government job. When he was out of sight in Java, the fact that he was in business wasn’t so bad. But now he was home, his determination not to don the uniform of a civil servant and bathe his parents in its reflected prestige was almost shameful. ‘People here educate their kids to be civil servants, not businessmen,’ he said.

Some of the obsession with civil service jobs may be a hangover from the chaos and hyperinflation of the mid-1960s. Salaries were worthless across the board, but government jobs at least came with something useful: rations of rice, cooking oil and sugar. At a time when poor Indonesians wore sackcloth in the marketplace, there was fabric, too, for uniforms. Perhaps that contributed to the uniform-mania that persists to this day. Indonesians love uniforms of every type. Civil servants, even ministers and bupatis, wear uniforms every day. Most central government agencies allow formal batik shirts on Fridays, and some local governments require a weekly showing of the traditional textiles of the region. The national red thread: an engraved name-tag, white on black plastic, and a little gold badge of office.

‘On the campaign trail, local politicians change clothes more often than Madonna during one of her concerts,’ the political scientist Michael Buehler said when I noted the uniform-mania. ‘The Governor of South Sulawesi is a bureaucrat in the morning, a boy scout at noon, a devout Muslim in the afternoon and a businessman in the evening.’

But from Indonesian mouths, ‘Kami di manja bumi’, ‘Mother Earth has spoiled us’, is something I heard over and over.

These fairs are an orgy of competitive identity-creation. And yet, observed Ed Aspinall, an Australian researcher of Indonesian politics, in response to my musing on the reinvention of local traditions, these ceremonies follow the same pattern nationwide. ‘To me it’s the local cultural stuff that seems cheap and ersatz,’ he said. ‘It’s the bureaucratic impulse and template that seem deep and authentic. It’s very Indonesian.’

Through energy subsidies, the government is channelling a fifth of its total spending into the pockets of middle-class people with cars, air-conditioners and microwaves.

‘Indonesia’s a really easy place to do business,’ he said. ‘If you’ve got an idea, you can just get on and make it happen.’ What about all the red tape, all the permits, all the fees? ‘Those come later,’ Ade said. If he gets asked to show his permit early on he simply explains that he’s just trying out the business, he doesn’t yet know if it will succeed. If it flies, he tells the authorities, then he’ll get all the permits he needs. ‘Everyone’s fine with that.’ A friend of mine who runs a dive resort agreed. I ran into her by chance at an airport in early 2012, when she was on her way to sort out building permits for the resort. Were they expanding? I asked. No, these were the permits for the existing bungalows, the ones built six years previously.

My yellow rain cape proved helpless in the face of water which sloshed and sprayed all around. The volunteers looked miserable. ‘In Ireland, we call this kind of weather “lumpy”,’ I shouted across the roar of engine and waves, fake-cheerfully. The young Dutchman nodded silently. Then he spoke for the first time. ‘In Holland,’ he said, ‘we call it “shit”.’

I closed my door and suddenly seven months of staying in damp, windowless flea-pits, of being woken at four by the mosque, five by the chickens and six by the schoolkids, seven months of defending my childlessness, being asked why I didn’t have any friends, being told I must have been pretty when I was young, seven months in a world without loo paper, alcohol or English conversation, seven months of wearing the same six pairs of knickers, of endlessly packing and repacking bags, seven months of getting over foot rot only to come out in a mystery rash, seven months of trying to make sense of things that made no sense, above all, seven months of trying to fit into a world that was, quite simply, not my world: it all came crashing down on me. I started really sobbing: hiccupy, snotty sort of sobbing.

When we were ordering food at a nasi Padang place in the trans town, I suggested chicken. Gentar stuck out his tongue in disgust: no real Rimba will eat an animal that has been raised by man, he said. The Rimba gather plants and roots to eat, as well as honey, rattan and wild rubber to sell.

She had recently been buying up ginger from other farmers as well, selling it on to Sidomuncul, one of the biggest manufacturers of Javanese traditional medicines, including Tolak Angin, a ginger- and honey-based tonic. In the same way that English speakers ‘catch a cold’, Indonesians are ‘entered by the wind’. To avoid this masuk angin, they drink Tolak Angin, which literally means Refuse the Wind.

This has wormed its way into the language. Asal Bapak Senang – ‘As long as Father is Happy’, usually shortened to ABS – means that you never had to think beyond carrying out the instructions of your superiors. And there’s belum dapat petunjuk, too: ‘I haven’t yet received my instructions.’ I used to hear these phrases all the time from bureaucrats in the Suharto era, when I was trying to get information about some development plan or financial deregulation package. Without orders from above, no one would even talk about anything, let alone do anything.

even the narrowest backstreets of Surabaya are lined with murals of open green landscapes fronted with rows of potted plants and flowers. There’s also a large network of Garbage Banks, run by an NGO with the support of the city government. These are not just places to get rid of recycled materials, like London’s bottle banks. They are real banks, with savings books, cash payments and interest rates. Individuals and neighbourhoods can sign up for an account. Their waste gets weighed and they get paid for it; 5,000 rupiah a kilo for clean plastic if they put it in their savings account, slightly less if they want to be paid in cash. The NGO then sells it on to recycling plants at 7,000.
