This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. It uses the minima theme. The code to show revision history on each page is taken from [this post](https://ryanjduffy.github.io/blog/2016/01/08/including-git-history-in-a-jekyll-post.html) by Ryan Duffy, as explained [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2020-10-11-revision-history.md %}).

The website lives in [this repository](https://github.com/louispotok/notebook).
